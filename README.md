# Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## Project Description

This assignment was to build classification models capable of detecting specific traffic signs from images using computer vision. The assignment requested two models to be built using CNN architecture: one which accepts color images and one which accepts grayscale images. A dataset containing over 39,000 samples images was used to train the models. The color and grayscale model performances were then compared.

## Project Features

* The datasets were normalized and one-hot encoded before training. The model was built and trained in Python using OpenCV2 and TensorFlow. 
* The grayscale model ended up with a loss value of 0.2813 and an accuracy score of 0.9317. The color model ended up with a loss value of 0.2541 and an accuracy score of 0.9282.
